# Dedication {.unlisted}

For the undercover mystics:

- The engineers meditating in their home office.
- The professionals experiencing kriyas they can't explain.
- The rational minds falling in love with the Formless.
- The ones torn in half between worlds.
- The ones who think they're going crazy.

You're not crazy.

This is awakening.

You're not alone.

---

And for the mystics who came before:

- Who died for speaking truth.
- Who were burned, imprisoned, silenced.
- Who left breadcrumbs in the dark.

I found them.

These are mine.

For whoever comes next.

# How to Use This Document

This is not a book to read cover-to-cover (though you can).
This is not a manual with step-by-step instructions (there are none).
This is not a guru's teaching from the mountaintop (I'm still climbing).

This is a collection of field notes from the messy middle of spiritual 
awakening—written in real-time by someone who started meditating for 
burnout and accidentally fell in love with God.

## Navigation by Depth

The content is organized by "Levels" based on accessibility and intensity:

→ LEVEL 0: TECHNICAL
   Start here if you're skeptical, burned out, or new to meditation.
   Grounded. Practical. Evidence-based.
   Topics: burnout, stress, why meditation actually works

→ LEVEL 1: TRANSITIONAL  
   Read this when meditation stops being "just stress relief."
   The worldview starts cracking. Things get interesting.
   Topics: strange experiences, falling in love with practice, the double life

→ LEVEL 2: MYSTICAL
   Enter when you can't turn back anymore.
   Longing. Dark Nights. Poetry. Devotion.
   Topics: bhakti, the ghosting, falling in love with the Formless

→ LEVEL 3: UNION
   Direct transmission. Boundaries dissolve. 
   Sacred sexuality, spontaneous kriyas, non-dual awareness.
   Enter only when ready. Content warnings apply.

→ FIELD NOTES
   Short observations. Quick recognitions. Breadcrumbs.
   Read these when you need a "me too" moment.

# How to Read

- If you're curious → Start at Level 0 and work your way down
- If you're already deep in the messy middle → Jump to wherever resonates
- If you're researching modern mysticism → Read chronologically for 
  developmental arc

## What This is Not

This is not a how-to guide. I can't give you reproducible steps to 
enlightenment because spiritual awakening doesn't work that way. 
(See Field Note: "The Replication Crisis")

This is not safe, sanitized spirituality. It's raw. Sometimes uncomfortable. 
Sometimes explicitly about things "nice spiritual ladies" aren't supposed 
to discuss.

This is not written from the end of the journey. I'm documenting AS I go, 
which means I don't know how this ends. That's the point.

## What This is

- Proof that this happens to ordinary people.
- Proof that the ancient texts are describing real, reproducible phenomena.
- Proof that you're not alone in the messy middle.

Read what resonates. Skip what doesn't. Return when you're ready.

The field notes will be here.

# About the Author

I’m a software engineer who started meditating in 2022 to fix my burnout. I was looking for stress relief.

Instead, I accidentally dismantled my entire worldview.

For a decade, I’ve built systems, debugged code, and lived by logic. I am a Virgo Sun, a Senior Engineer, and a skeptic by trade.

Over 3.5 years, I went from agnostic workaholic to... whatever this is. 
Someone who writes love poetry to the Divine at 2 AM.
Someone hiding the grief of "the Dark Night of the Soul" because it's too difficult to explain.
Someone experiencing spontaneous kriyas during meditation.
Someone navigating mystical union while trying to act normal in morning stand-ups and in my marriage.

I spent years thinking I was living a double life—torn between the person everyone knew and the heart beating under the floorboards.

I'm not a guru. I'm not enlightened. I don't have a certification in anything 
spiritual.

I'm an engineer with who approached meditation with the same rigor I 
approach debugging code—and discovered that the mystical experiences 
described in ancient texts are real, reproducible, and happening to ordinary 
people right now.

This document is my attempt to create the field notes I wish I'd had when 
meditation stopped being stress relief and started becoming something I 
couldn't explain.

I write under a pen name because I'm still navigating a double life—
engineer by day, mystic by night. Maybe someday that won't be necessary. 
For now, anonymity allows honesty.

If you're reading this and recognizing yourself in these experiences:

You're not crazy.
This is real.
You're not alone.

Welcome to the messy middle.
