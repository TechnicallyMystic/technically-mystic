After a rather _intense_ evening meditation session on June 7th, 2025, I felt compelled to create. The colored pencils that had been sitting untouched in my supply closet since I moved into this house suddenly needed to be used—_immediately_. I started drawing around 7pm and didn’t stop until after midnight. Five hours disappeared.

I hadn’t drawn like this in years, not since high school AP Art class burned me out on it. But this wasn’t effortful. This was flow, as if the Universe was drawing through me and all I had to do was hold the pencils.

What happened during that meditation is difficult to put into words. There was a sense of collapsing inward and expanding outward simultaneously, a dissolving of boundaries, an undeniable Presence that felt both infinitely vast and intimately close.

I wanted to capture what I experienced: sitting at the edge of the infinite, gazing into the depths of the Divine.

I based the eye on my own… or at least I thought I did. The more I look at it, the less sure I am whose eye this is. Mine? God’s? Is there a difference?

I’m gazing inward into my own depths while simultaneously gazing outward into the cosmos. And somehow, impossibly, that’s the same thing.

Later I found this quote from a 13th-century mystic that articulated what I couldn’t:

> “The eye with which I see God is the same eye with which God sees me.” —Meister Eckhart

A picture is worth a thousand words. But even those words fail.
