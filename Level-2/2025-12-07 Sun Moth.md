## Intro
This came during sound bath. I was told to write it. So here it is.

---
I had wings when I finally woke up.

I didn't know how long the night had been. But finally, as I stirred before dawn, they were unfolding, fragile.

As I struggled to remember anything at all, the Spirit of the Moth came.

It told me of my life prior.

---
I had been crawling on the earth for my entire life.

Was I a snake? A worm? A slug?

I knew not.

I was in quite a different world, surrounded by those just like me, all striving, struggling against their own forms just to live.

And the ones that didn't?

Died.

There was one day that a peculiar thought came to me: there was more than this.

I didn't wonder it--I knew it.

And I had to find it.

A gnawing hunger started eating at my chest at night. It howled from deep within and kept me awake. No one around me seemed to hear it.

I crawled out of my home one night into the dark, yearning, yet afraid of its depths.

I crawled, not knowing which way to go, only that I must. Only that I had to move forward.

My hunger grew as I crawled across the desert of my own longing. The sun burned me until it set, leaving me to the bitter, slowing cold. I cried out in protest. I had to move.

The darkness closed in around me, encasing me like a cocoon. That was the last thing I could remember.

When I finally awoke before dawn's light, something had shifted, unfolded, unfurled from within--wings.

"There is a great Light," the Moth Spirit said, its great eyes sparkling like galaxies. "It lies in the Beyond."

That was the last thing the Spirit said before turning and flying off into the horizon at a mighty speed.

I stood there stunned until I realized: dawn was breaking.

I saw what I thought was the sun flash over the horizon.

It was... fluttering.

It was a giant flaming moth.

I stood in awe as I watched it fly over me.

And then I started chasing it.

My wings flapped frantically as they carried me onward into the sky.

The next thing I knew, I was floating in space. There was a burning. And then an eruption into--

## Field Note: Origin Story 
During the heart chakra-themed sound bath where this prose came through, I felt what I thought was kundalini pull up her tail from my root and coil around my heart. Possessively. My pulse seemed to intensify as she wrapped herself around it.  
I don't know if that's documented. I don't know if anyone else experiences this.  
I just know: She claimed me.  
And then this story poured out.

As I was writing it up immediately afterwards before even going home, I realized it was the sequel to [Desert Worm](https://technicallymystic.com/p/desert-worm-3a1). I didn’t intend to write a sequel. Yet here it is.

I went back and looked at Desert Worm, written almost a year ago. At the end of the poem, a promise was given to me, a prophecy fulfilled:

> _Thy faith has given thee wings._ **_Now fly to Me.”_**
