Subtitle: [Level 2: Mystical] I joined the weirdest "startup" of all time
Posted: Nov 15, 2025

I was hired on 11-11.
I swear I had no idea at the time. (See the footnote[1]).
Or at least, that was the date I *remembered* I was already hired.

This is the story of how I accidentally said yes to the weirdest job offer of my life.

I don’t do astrology. Too vague. I knew I was a Virgo and that was about it.

When I was researching dark retreats (because _of course_ I was), the facilitator needed my birth chart. Something about coaching participants through an ancient Buddhist practice that’s legitimately hard, especially for the terminally-online.

So I pulled it up... and promptly had an existential crisis at my desk. Virgo sun (precision, service). Aries moon (spiritual warrior energy). Aquarius rising (bridge between worlds). And then, the knockout: a Scorpio North Node in the 9th house (a soul-level assignment to go beyond superficial beliefs and dive headfirst into the “unseen and the taboo”).

My resume… or my job description? I’m still trying to figure out how to read this.

My life’s purpose, according to this chart, is to embark on a “discovery journey”, uncover the transformative power of spiritual truth, and then, having lived through that transformation, become a guide for others. I felt like I’d just discovered my own job description, written the minute I was born. I was literally engineered to build bridges... between the mundane and mystical.

I went back through my old journals. There were months of notes, years even, many structured like I was planning to share them. They were organized, indexed, _intentional_, but never published. Just sitting there, waiting.

Two posts total had made it out, both to a private spiritual community where I knew people would “get it.”

The rest? Locked away because I didn’t know how to share them. I wasn’t ready and didn’t want to show the messy middle.

But my chart didn’t care about my excuses. My chart showed me what I’d forgotten: my actual mission. My title. The job I’d been avoiding. So I said yes. Not a brave leap…more like finally clocking in for a shift I was three years late to.

The next 3 days were onboarding:
- buying the domain
- setting up the Substack and Instagram (before I could talk myself out of it)
- gathering the harvest from my notes
- writing intro posts for the Substack and Instagram (still in disbelief this was now happening)
- planting seeds for future posts
- sharing my first REAL impactful professional-facing piece of work that got results
During this time I could *feel* a shift inside me. It like something was now flowing and waking up as if my system was starting to "come online". 

Then on November 15th, I was told in the shower that I was to receive on-the-job training. I did 30 minutes before my "shift" started that redefined the whole project scope as I met with an ambassador from the grounded, logical, questioning side of reality and was taught to take notes and requests for the mystical side to answer. I then met with the Co-Founders (or rather they manifested what we'll refer to as *Consciousness* and *Energy*—the mystical business partners running this whole operation) right after my "training". They brought me to the "boardroom" for instruction. After a brief "meeting", the door closed and I was left with a direction to go, no deadlines to rush towards, and the deliverables are unclear.

My schedule is 7 pm to midnight, the "magic hours" where the energy seems to love to dance.

The pay is shit—pure spiritual fulfillment, which doesn't cover rent—but the work-life balance is... well, there is no balance. It's all work. And it's all life. Which is the whole point, I guess. It's *integration*, not *renunciation*.

So why was I hired? The Co-Founders asked me: **Where are the mystics' field notes?**
We have plenty of memoirs written AFTER the journey. But what about reports FROM the journey?
What if someone documented the messy middle—the "I don't know if this is real", the "am I even qualified" (impostor syndrome just like in my day job), the "holy shit the Co-Founders just kicked me out of the boardroom so They could finish Their business in private"?
We have TONS of 'I climbed the mountain and here's what I learned' books. But where's the 'I'm halfway up, my knees hurt, I think I see God but it might be altitude sickness' content?
That's what this Substack is. Field notes from someone who said yes to the weirdest job offer ever—and is still figuring out what the hell she signed up for.

But honestly? I love this job.

I'm a field reporter for the mystics in the making. 
I'm "technically" mystic. And if you're reading this—you might be moonlighting too.
No resume required. Just say yes.

## P.S.
If you’re wondering whether this is real or just a very elaborate metaphor: yes.

## Footnotes
[1] After making this post, I looked up “11 11 meaning” in incognito since I knew vaguely of it as just one of those “spiritual numbers” people would note on digital clocks and figured I should learn more about the significance. Literally the second link on DuckDuckGo was titled: “The 11/11 Portal: Unlocking the Gateway of Spiritual Awakening” ([https://nypost.com/astrology/the-1111-portal-unlocking-the-gateway-of-spiritual-awakening/](https://nypost.com/astrology/the-1111-portal-unlocking-the-gateway-of-spiritual-awakening/)). Out of morbid curiosity, I clicked and started reading. Not long after, I was reeling as it dawned on me how freakishly it aligned with what actually happened on that day in hindsight. Out of all 365 days of the year and this was the day I said yes. God apparently has a sense of humor and I'm just slow on the uptake.
