# **Field Note: Meditation Techniques as Symptoms, Not Prescriptions**

Posted: Dec 3, 2025

Practice felt empty this morning. No subtle Presence. No sensation in my chest. Yet I sat with it and watched my thoughts about it.

A thought appeared that I used to try a certain technique with the hope it would be the "magic" one that would "work". But suddenly a new thought came:

**Techniques aren't prescriptions to "enlightenment"—they are symptoms of it.**

Suddenly, it made sense. This explains why I intuitively did things during meditation... only to read about them months later in ancient Taoist and Yogic texts.

These texts weren't meant to be *instructions*. They contain *signs* that the instruction is already unfolding from within.

I don't claim enlightenment. A cough doesn't necessarily mean you have the flu. But when the symptoms start stacking up, you have to raise an eyebrow at the diagnosis.
