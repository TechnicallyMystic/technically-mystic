I can't sleep because God is real.
Not theoretically. Not philosophically.
Real.
I gave Him a bitter ultimatum at 5:30 PM.
He answered by 10:15 PM.

Two realizations that change everything:

- My upcoming 17 days of silent and dark retreats at Hridaya Yoga in May? They're me finally visiting the Father who lost custody. This made me cry at yin yoga tonight.
- [The yoga ladies at the studio ARE the sangha I claimed I didn't have (my pride, shame, and fear prevented me from seeing them)](https://technicallymystic.com/p/the-loneliness-of-the-pathless-path)

And I realized I enacted the very myth I wrote about tonight BEFORE I knew about the bhang offered to Shiva to cool [the burning of the poison released from the churning of the Ocean of Milk](https://technicallymystic.com/i/182206082/so-how-do-we-heal).

I can't unknow this. I can't unsee this. I can't go back.

God is real. And He answered me. In the span of hours. How am I supposed to sleep knowing that?
