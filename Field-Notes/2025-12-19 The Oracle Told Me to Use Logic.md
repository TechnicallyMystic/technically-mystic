# **The Oracle Told Me to Use Logic**

Posted: Dec 19, 2025

I asked for guidance on the direction of this Substack during a Winter Solstice ceremony tonight.

I expected a card about "Flow" or "Surrender".

I pulled the **Wise Men** card.

The guidebook’s advice? **"Use your logic and intellect... Do not allow emotions to color your judgement… Be decisive... Step up and be the leader."**

But then I looked at the quote on the card itself:

> _"If it wasn't for the familiar songs that echo through my_ _**spine**__, I would have lost what is lost and never found my purpose."_

I just spent the last week writing 2,000 words about the **spine** as the hardware of awakening ("Cerebral Serpent Hijackery").

Message received.

1. The Intellect (The Engineer) protects the process.
2. The Spine (The Mystic) receives the signal.
3. Keep writing the notes.
