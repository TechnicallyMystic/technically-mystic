A friend dropped this in the group meme chat today. They have zero context on the "weird" side of my life—they just thought it was a funny meme about nuns. I laughed a little too hard because of how accurate it is.

As seekers, we tend to obsess over Panel 3. We chase the *ecstatic visions* in meditation or think they are the point of any earnest spiritual practice. I certainly did.

But if you look closely, the visions aren't the destination. They're just... sandwiched between the daily routines and the mundane necessities.

The real practice isn't the ecstacy itself. It's in picking up the rake immediately after the Universe melts your face off.

Panel 4 is where the integration happens.
