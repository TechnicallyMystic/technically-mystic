**Field Note: Channeling my Inner Iyengar (Apparently)**
Posted: Dec 30, 2025

So it happened again.

I tried something in meditation and for yin poses at home and it worked _too_ well. I was so amazed I thought, "Okay this HAS to be a thing right? Why haven't I heard of it before?"

(Spoiler: of course it’s a thing.)

**Weighted props in yin yoga aren't ancient.** Sandbags were largely introduced in the 1970s.

B.K.S. Iyengar is credited with the idea. Even as an advanced yogi, he sometimes struggled to release deep tension. In 1965, unable to relax his hips in butterfly pose, he grabbed stones from the road and placed them on his thighs.

He discovered that passive weight tricks the nervous system into releasing what active effort can't.

**I just did the exact same thing.**

This evening I felt compelled to use my new 20lb weighted blanket, folding it and draping it over my shoulders in meditation. My tight muscles FINALLY let go, causing spinal kriyas.

Afterwards I used it folded on my upper back in puppy pose. My spine released and popped in places it never has before in that pose.

I didn't "rediscover" an ancient technique. I followed the same embodied intuition that CREATED the technique 60 years ago.

My body knew what it needed.

Just like Iyengar's did.

**Just like yours does.**

The techniques aren't handed down from on high.

They arise when you listen to what your body is asking for.

_That's the practice._

Has your body ever “invented” a technique that you later found out was a real thing?
