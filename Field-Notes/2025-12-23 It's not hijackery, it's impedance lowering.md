**Field Report Update: It's not hijackery, it's impedance lowering**
Posted: Dec 23, 2025

5 days since publishing “Cerebral Serpent Hijackery” and I’ve had **3 discoveries** about what might be preventing you from experiencing kriyas for yourself during meditation:

1. **Ohm’s law applies to your spine too.** Tension (resistance) impedes Shakti (energetic current) flowing through the spine. A full-body scan + relaxing of previously unconscious shoulder holding → instant energetic faucet opening + jolt.
2. **The spine needs to be balanced like a tent pole, not just “straight”.** Effortless alignment = relaxed micro-muscles = energy can flow freely.
3. **Bandhas + breathwork are INTENSE.** On a low-energy day, I tried manually directing the energy upward with locks as documented by Dr. Joe Dispenza. My heart pounded, pressure built, and strong kriyas immediately followed on release for each repetition. Also my altar candle went haywire halfway through. 🕯️
