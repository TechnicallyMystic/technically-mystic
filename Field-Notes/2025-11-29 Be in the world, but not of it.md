# **Field Note: "Be in the world, but not of it"**

I was musing this morning about departing from consensus reality mentally while still managing to operate in the world as normal (doing decently at your job, maintaining healthy relationships, taking care of your body, etc).

It then dawned on me that this is another understanding of the phrase "Be in the world, but not of it."

I originally thought it was about living with detachment, but realized it's about holding the mystical while operating from the technical.

"Integration, not renunciation." That's the goal of this Substack.
