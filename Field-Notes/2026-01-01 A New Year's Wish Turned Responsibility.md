**Field Note: A New Year's Wish Turned Responsibility**
Posted: Jan 1, 2026

---
Now that it's officially the new year, I went upstairs to check a folded-up slip of paper that was waiting for me. I had written it, but didn't know what it said—it was the last survivor of the original 12.

During the winter solstice celebration at my local studio, we were given kits to take home with the candles we had made. The instructions in the kit:

> 12 WISHES SOLSTICE RITUAL
> 
> - START THIS ON THE 21ST
> - USE THESE 12 PIECES OF PAPER TO WRITE 12 WISHES FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR. (BIG OR SMALL - TOTALLY UP TO YOU)
> - FOLD THEM UP SO YOU CAN'T SEE THEM & PUT THEM BACK IN THE ENVELOPE.
> - BEGINNING ON THE SOLSTICE NIGHT, BURN ONE EACH NIGHT (NO PEEKING).
> - ON JANUARY 1ST, YOU WILL HAVE ONE LEFT TO OPEN.
> - THAT WISH IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE YEAR; THE OTHER 11 WISHES WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF BY YOUR GUIDES, ANCESTORS, SOUL TEAM.

These were my 12 wishes, 11 of which were consumed by the flame of the candles we crafted:

1. Feel closer to [my spouse]
2. My post(s) help someone
3. Feel happier with my career
4. Receive transmissions more clearly to help myself and others
5. Feel a greater sense of peace
6. Fight less with my doubts
7. Have a profoundly transformative silent / dark retreat
8. The Substack to be successful
9. Receive the guidance I need on my spiritual journey for fulfilling my mission
10. Greater health in 2026 (no COVID on birthday)
11. Get more sleep
12. Become a better bridge between the mundane and mystical

Look which one was waiting for me to open it.

What's funny is that when I was down to the last two earlier this evening, about to burn one of them, _this one fell into my lap_ when I had both in my hand and was shuffling them around. I burned what remained in my hand. I set the one in my lap aside and came back after midnight to read the surprise.

Looking at the others—the ones I'd photographed before folding and placing into the envelope for selection over the past 11 days—it feels like a wink from the Universe:

**"We've got the other eleven. That one's on you."**

So here I am, on the first day of 2026, with my marching orders.

Happy New Year, fellow travelers. What's _your_ responsibility this year?
