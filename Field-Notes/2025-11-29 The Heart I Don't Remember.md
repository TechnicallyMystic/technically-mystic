# **Field Note: The Heart I Don't Remember**

Posted: Nov 29, 2025

I stayed up late to put up the tree even though I was tired from the past couple days with family. Among our usual ornaments, I found one I don't remember ever buying: a large, bright red glass heart.

Without thinking, I reached up and placed it as high on the tree as I could. I stepped back to observe and the mind kicked in: That looks goofy. It's too much.

So I moved it to the middle. It seemed more reasonable there. But as I stood looking at the tree again, I realized what I'd just done:

I had literally moved my heart lower to make it more acceptable.

By default, the real me, before thought, had placed the ornament as high as I could reach. And because of that, that's where it belongs.

So I put it back.

Not for the tree.

For me.
