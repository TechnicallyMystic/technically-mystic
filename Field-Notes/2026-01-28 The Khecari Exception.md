# **Field Note: The Khecari Exception**

Posted: Jan 28, 2026

Yesterday in meditation my brain decided to put on its QA hat for a post I wrote almost 2 months ago:

> Hang on... if "techniques are symptoms and not prescriptions"...what the &^%# is Khecari mudra?? There's NO way someone spontaneously did that shit while awakening.

Techniques *can* be symptoms, not prescriptions as I wrote (https://technicallymystic.com/p/when-being-becomes-doing-not-the), but it's not universally true for *all* practices.

The Khecari Mudra is something that I once thought was a joke someone was making on the HealthyGamer community until I actually looked it up. It's...honestly unsettling. From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khecar%C4%AB_mudr%C4%81):

> The tongue is made long enough to do this with many months of daily tongue stretching and, in some versions of the practice, by gradually severing the frenulum of the tongue with a sharp implement over a period of months.

The odds of a meditation practitioner *spontaneously* curling their tongue back until it reaches *into the nasal cavity WITHOUT cutting anything*?? No way (though if anyone has ever heard of a "spontaneous Khecari" without the surgical assist, please drop a comment and blow my mind).

So it seems there are three categories of techniques in the yogic texts:
1. **Spontaneous symptoms** that arise naturally during awakening (e.g. spine jolts, mudras not previously learned)
 2. **Deliberate practices** that can be taught and learned to create conditions for facilitating awakening (sadhanas, Khecari mudra)
 3. **Hybrid phenomena** that can arise spontaneously OR be deliberately cultivated (mula bandha, sahajoli mudra)

The texts don't clearly label which is which.
Is this describing what happened *to* the yogi?
Or is this prescribing what the yogi *did*?

I once thought they fell into the second bucket—practices discovered by trial and error. But from my experience, the more I've followed deliberate practices, the more I've seen spontaneous symptoms and hybrid phenomena arise.

Yet, for some reason, the Khecari mudra popped into my head last night and made me question the entire framework of "When Being Becomes Doing, NOT the Other Way Around".

Frustratingly, as I'm discovering more and more, the answer is that annoying koan of a slogan that might as well be a punchline at this point: **Both and Neither**.
