**Field Note: 4:30 AM at the In-Laws**

What does modern mysticism look like?

I don't know.

But what I do know is I spent all Thanksgiving visiting both sides of my family, having no time at all to meditate, feeling absolutely exhausted at the end of the day, then climbing into the guest bed at my in-laws at night and noticing that every breath, every heartbeat sounded like "God... God... God..." before drifting off to sleep… only to get woken up by my husband crawling into bed much later and then tossing and turning.

So now I'm writing this instead of sleeping at 4:30 AM.
