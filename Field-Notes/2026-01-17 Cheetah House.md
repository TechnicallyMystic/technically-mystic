# **Field Note: Cheetah House**

Posted: Jan 17, 2026

I've been writing about a sensitive, yet heavy topic: how libido naturally evolves as spiritual practices deepen and how that affects romantic partnerships.

I've been sitting on a couple drafts, tentatively titled "When Brahmacharya Becomes Involuntary" and "When Meditation Feels Like Cheating", doubting if anyone else was experiencing this and if my field notes on the arising phenomena would help anyone. Instead, I found a resource that proved I wasn't alone.

[Cheetah House](https://www.cheetahhouse.org/symptoms) (a play on the Sanskrit word _citta_, meaning both "mind" and "heart") is a nonprofit research organization founded by Dr. Willoughby Britton that documents meditation-related difficulties. They have an entire symptom database cataloging things like:

- Changes in libido (loss or hyper-arousal)
- Involuntary movements (kriyas)
- Changes in mood (crying, irritability, grief)
- Energy sensations (heat, pressure)
- Change in sense of self (embodiment, boundaries, narrative)
- Change in effort / striving, motivations / goals

As I went through their list, I saw all the things that I've been experiencing and documenting privately for years.
All the things I thought were "just me."
All documented, validated by other meditators.

I'm leaving this breadcrumb here for all those who are where I was at even just a year ago. If you're navigating the messy middle and wondering if you're losing your mind—you're not.
The symptoms are documented.
The experiences are real. 
You're not alone.
