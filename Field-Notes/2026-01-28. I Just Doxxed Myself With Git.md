# **Field Note: I Just Doxxed Myself With Git**

Posted: Jan 28, 2026

---

So far, I've been carefully maintaining separation between my professional identity and my mystical documentation.

Then I committed to GitHub with the wrong SSH key (different laptop than I'm used to). My real identity showed up in the commit log for approximately two minutes before I:

- **Panicked** (It felt like I’d just leaked a non-rotatable API token.)
- **Rewrote git history**
- **Force-pushed to main**
- **Blocked my personal account**

_"You must lose something every day."_ Today I lost anonymity.

I'm realizing I'm still clinging to separation, still afraid to let the compartmentalization dissolve, still afraid of complete integration between the mystical and mundane. The engineer in me still desperately wants to "fix the build," even if the "build" is just spiritual documentation and the "bug" is accidental vulnerability.

Even if God literally JUST told me to practice detachment.

I'll try again tomorrow.
