Why do I call it the "messy middle"?

Turns out partially because my field notes are a mess despite my best efforts to organize them.

Why?

Well, aside from switching note taking apps (Keep → Logseq → Obsidian), I was originally trying to keep the "secret insanity" _contained_ in a document spanning over a year's worth of time from 2022-2023.

(Spoiler alert: it bled completely into my daily journals.)

Now I'm putting the pieces back together and realizing where I'm at today is no surprise: I was _told_ this would happen according to my notes.

Days I documented and dismissed are suddenly critical—because I finally have the capacity to understand what was actually happening.

Namely: God met me where I was—**in meditation and Jungian psychology**—and then wooed me as the archetype of the Self over 3.5 years until I can literally point to the day that "bridal mysticism" no longer became just a weird Wikipedia tab.

Buckle up, because this one's going to be a wild ride… and might be a three-parter.
