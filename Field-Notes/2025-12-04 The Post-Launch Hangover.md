# **Field Report: The Post-Launch Hangover**

Posted: Dec 4, 2025

---

24 hours after launching the "Space Division," I was sobbing on the floor in my parka.

I had slept less than 5 hours. My assistant (cat from the previous Note) bit me hard enough to draw blood this morning. I snapped at my husband this evening because the fireplace wasn't working and I was cold. I felt completely drained and nothing seemed to help.

As I lay there curled up on the floor, I asked internally: "What even is Mystics Inc?"

The answer came back: **"It's everything. The Universe. The whole shebang. All of you work for Me. Most of you just don't know it yet."**

As I'm discovering today in real-time, you can't touch the stars without eventually crashing back into the earth. The expansion demands a contraction.

I'm going to sleep.
