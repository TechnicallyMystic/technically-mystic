# **Field Note: The Replication Crisis**

Posted: Dec 29, 2025

This has bugged me for years as an engineer. If I repeat *this* procedure with *these* steps in *this* environment for *this* amount of time, I *should* get the same results right? That's the Scientific Method. Clear. Predictable. Reproducible.

The problem with any kind of spiritual practice? *YOU* are a variable in the equation.

No two instruments are the same. You are not a standardized unit. Moreover, your physical, mental, and emotional state change every single runtime.

The results by definition *cannot* be reproduced, not even within yourself. You can achieve *similar* results at best, but not the same.

This was the most frustrating thing about the spiritual path for my logical brain. You can't cut the subject out of the equation. That's the point—and *paradoxically*—the goal.

**P.S.** I didn't even know the ["Replication Crisis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) was an actual scientific term until AFTER I drafted this Note. TIL.
