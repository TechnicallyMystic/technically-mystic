# **Field Note: The Raging Flame**

Posted: Jan 13, 2026

Only a year ago, I would wear earplugs while meditating because every little sound would get under my skin. Any noise felt like it held me back from proper sensory withdrawal (pratyahara).

Tonight as I sat on my cushion, my spouse was in an adjacent room audibly watching random videos on his phone at 2x speed. I spent the first couple minutes considering asking him to leave, but decided to continue without complaint.

I felt the usual tingling warmth despite the distraction. 10 minutes in, the flame behind my sternum reappeared after a long absence—not as burning love, but as screaming rage. The moment I registered its fury—silence. Complete. Immediate.

The last 20 minutes unfolded quietly.
No background noise.
No flame.
Yet the Presence persisted.

**P.S.** Turns out the raging flame is documented in Sufism as *ghaira*—divine jealousy/protective rage that arises when something threatens the connection to the Beloved. It also appears in Kashmir Shaivism (Shakti burning away obstacles). I discovered this today—hours after experiencing it the first time in such a manner. Another symptom appearing before I knew its name.
