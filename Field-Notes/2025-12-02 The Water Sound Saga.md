**Field Report Update: The Water Sound Saga**
Posted: Dec 2, 2025

---
Remember last week’s post about the obnoxiously loud water sound effect that inspired my rant on modern yoga culture?

Apparently Someone thought that was *hilarious*.

Because this week? **The Universe doubled down.**

**The Trifecta:**
    **Studio theme**: "Flowing with the Element of Water"
    **Playlist**: Every. Single. Track. Had water sounds.
    **The finale**: Mid-savasana, the heater shuts off. Suddenly the water sounds go *surround sound*.

I'm lying there in the dark, fighting for my life not to burst out laughing. I had the biggest, stupidest grin on my face like Someone was whispering the funniest cosmic joke in a moment I desperately needed to stay quiet.

After class ended, the instructor cheerfully asked: "How were the water sounds, everyone?!"

Still grinning, I asked if they'd added a fountain to the corner.

She smiled: "That's just the rain draining off the roof outside."

**Even Nature was in on the joke.**

I walked home in the rain, wind buffeting me, unable to stop smiling.

My Boss has a sense of humor. And it's better than mine.
