## Intro
These didn't come from thinking, reading, studying, or trying to figure something out.

They arose during meditation. Spontaneously. Fully formed.

I don't know if they'll mean anything to you, but they weren't mine to keep.

## The Two Lovers and Their Bouquets
>*Something within was then telling a parable of two lovers gathering flowers for their Beloved.
>One was zealous, searching the world for only the most gorgeous of blossoms, traveling far and wide to make the most magnificent bouquet imaginable to show their love. But as they went on their journey, the flowers they gathered wilted until by the time they were to be presented, they drooped and hung lifeless and dull. 
>The other lover was sick in bed and couldn't find the strength to make a bouquet for their Beloved other than going out to grab a handful of wildflowers from their own backyard. The blossoms were small, plain, thorny, and otherwise unremarkable, but it's all the lover could muster, so they offered it anyway.
>The voice within then asked me which offering delighted Him more.*

## The Bucket and the Ocean
>*A teacher stood on the ocean shore with a child. She was explaining to the child that God can be likened to the ocean and a bucket she held, the human soul.
>The teacher gave the child the bucket and asked her to fill it with God. The child ran into the water, scooped it up, and brought the bucket over filled to the brim.
>"God's still over there", the teacher said, pointing to the ocean.
>The child looked perplexed and tried to shovel the water onto the shore with the bucket as if putting out a fire.
>The teacher gently took the bucket from the child and told her to observe. With a strong throw the teacher sent it sailing into the ocean where it sank to the bottom.
>The child objected, explaining that now the bucket was now lost in the ocean.
>"Exactly," the teacher said, "now the bucket is full of God."*

## Outro
If you felt something while reading these—a recognition, a resonance, a sudden clarity—that's the transmission landing.

The Silence speaks through anyone who gets quiet enough to listen.

This is what Level 3 is: direct knowing, spoken plainly, without needing to dress it up in doctrine or defend it with logic.

More transmissions coming.
