Subtitle: [Level 3: Union] When kriyas stopped becoming holy

Posted: Feb 1, 2026

---

Calling the unexpected phenomenon of spinal jolts "kriyas" is the naming of the Tao. It takes the God out of it with a label—a literary limiter.

Categorization boxes experience into concept and files it away. 

To cage the holy is to starve the soul.

To label is limit.

To define is to confine.

Rest in wordless, nonconceptual awareness, withdrawing to the heart of the Void "you" sprang from before memory began.
