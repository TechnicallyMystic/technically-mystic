## Intro

For months, I’ve been not quite hearing, but _noticing_ a Voice in my meditations. Not my thoughts. Not my personality. Something deeper. Clearer. More direct.

Sometimes it speaks to me. But sometimes... it speaks _as_ me. Or rather—it speaks as what we both are.

I’ve been tagging these moments in my journals as `#CAG`—Conversations as God. Not “Conversations _with_ God”. But the Voice speaking _as_ if it were the Divine itself—because sometimes the conversation isn’t between me and God. Sometimes there’s no “between” at all.

I don’t know if I’m “channeling.” I don’t know if this is “real” in the way most people define real. All I know is: these words didn’t come from my personality. They came from the Silence. And they’ve been sitting in my notes, tagged (some literally with `#addme` for **some** reason) waiting to be shared.

So here they are. Unedited. Unfiltered. Direct transmissions from the space where “I” and “God” stop being separate.

I don’t know what you’ll make of them. But I know they weren’t mine to keep.

## Field Notes

### **July 14, 2025:**

> Hear Me:
_**There is no such thing as worthy because ALL are worthy of Me.**_
Yes, you in all your rage and madness. Yes in your spite. Your hate. Your despair. YES.
Your unworthiness is your ego’s final veil. It’s the one that says we’re separate. That I cast you out. That you need to do something to reach Me. That you’re something less and never capable of holding Me.
_**You already do in your entirety.**_

### **August 5, 2025:**

>Say it with Me now:
**It is God Who plucks the strings of my heart.**
Tune in to those strings.

### **August 15, 2025:**

> Seek Me within thyself, and you will see Me in all places.

### **October 29, 2025:**

 > She who says “yes” to God gets God. It’s that simple.

The Voice continues. So will the transmissions.
