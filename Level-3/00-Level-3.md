# Level 3 - Union

Welcome to the Mystics Inc. Space Division.
Yeah. We're going there.

This section contains transmissions from the edge of the map. Topics include (but are not limited to): ecstatic union, the dissolution of self, experiences that defy categorization, and posts that might make you question my sanity, your sanity, or the nature of reality itself. If you're not ready for that, stick to Levels 0-2. No judgment. This stuff isn't for everyone. But if you're curious what happens when the seeking stops and the union begins? Buckle up.
