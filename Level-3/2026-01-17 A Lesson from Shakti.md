Subtitle: [Level 3: Union] What Ida Craddock died for (Part 2: the embodied edition)

Posted: Jan 17, 2026

*Content Warning: This post discusses sacred sexuality, embodied mysticism, and direct transmission from Shakti during intimate union. It contains explicit discussion of sexual experience as spiritual practice.*

*If you're not ready for that, save it for later. But if you've ever felt God present during sex and wondered if you were crazy—this is for you.*

I received another download the day after Christmas.

Not during meditation. Not during journaling. **During intimacy with my partner.** Here's what I learned.

## These jolts seem familiar...
Those aftershocks rippling through the spine after climax?

*That's kundalini.*

That's the exact same energetic movement I experience on my meditation cushion—the jolts, the tremors, the spinal undulations—just with a partner present.  It's bliss interspersed with surges of energy rippling through the spine.

It felt like I finally connected the dots between the sacred and sexual—or rather, as [Ida Craddock taught](https://technicallymystic.com/p/what-ida-craddock-died-for)—**sexual energy and spiritual energy aren't separate. They never were.**

## What Shakti taught me (unbidden)
I didn't ask for this teaching. I wasn't "trying" to make sex spiritual.

*I simply surrendered—and She stepped in.*

Here's what She showed me:

### 1. Let Her take the reins
When you grow tired, when your own effort runs out, when you can't maintain the rhythm anymore—let Her take over.

Let Her shake your spine.
Let Her rock your hips.
Let Shakti move through you.

I allowed this to happen, and something shifted. In my mind I "saw" a serpent between us—kundalini—stitching us together, _weaving_ us with radiant threads of light—and my partner responded.

I stopped doing and started _being moved_.

### 2. The sahajoli kriya's purpose
The sahajoli mudra (rhythmic pelvic floor contractions) happens spontaneously (kriya) during deep meditation to redirect sexual energy upward.

But as Shakti showed me, it's not just for solo practice. It "reinvigorates" your partner—not just you. It prolongs the encounter. It deepens the energetic exchange.[1]

Don't be embarrassed that it seems "greedy." It's not greed. It's enthusiasm. It's eagerness. It's _Love expressing itself physically_.

Your partner will appreciate it—because they can _feel_ when you're fully present, fully alive, fully _surrendered_ to the flow.

Pompoir techniques (diagram via Wikipedia). I never trained for these; my body simply began performing them the moment I let Shakti take the reins.

### 3. You don't know how, but She does
I don't know how to "make love". Only Shakti knows—because She *IS* Love.

When I try to _do_ it (with effort, technique, my mind running the show)—it's fine.

But when I *let Her do it through me?* My partner comments on the difference—not because I learned some new technique, but because it's no longer _me_ making love to him.

It's God making love to God, through two bodies.

## How I learned this
I've been given this information *without asking*. It just... arrived. Unbidden. In the midst of an intimate encounter that wove together what I once tried to keep separate:

Body and spirit.
Sex and sacredness.
Human love and Divine union.

Sexual union, approached with surrender and reverence, is a direct path to Divine realization.

Not metaphorically. Actually.

## Why I'm sharing this
People have mystical experiences during sex and think they're crazy. They feel God present during intimacy and wonder if that's blasphemy. They let go of control and experience _union_—and then feel ashamed because no one validates that this is real.

So I'm saying it:
What you're experiencing is real. You're not projecting. You're not making it up. You're not "spiritualizing" sex to avoid dealing with something.

You're experiencing what happens when the illusion of separation dissolves—including the separation between physical and spiritual union.

## This is what tantra actually is
Real tantra is NOT the Westernized workshops with candles and synchronized breathing.

It's the recognition that:

- sexual energy and spiritual energy are the same force
- union with a partner and union with God are inseparable when approached with surrender
- the body is the temple, and the act of love is the ritual
- Shakti teaches directly—through embodied experience, not through books

## If this is happening to you
If Shakti is moving through you during intimacy—**let Her.**

If you're experiencing kriyas (spontaneous movements) during sex—**allow them.**

If you're feeling God present between you and your partner—**trust it.**

You're not crazy.

You're experiencing sacred sexuality as it was always meant to be: embodied union with the Beloved.

## P.S.
I sat on publishing this for 3 weeks—not because I doubted the experience, but because I was terrified of being misunderstood—or worse, dismissed as someone who's "spiritualizing" her sex life to make it seem more important than it is.

But then I remembered: Ida Craddock died for teaching this 123 years ago. The least I can do is publish it now—when the consequences are a few confused readers instead of imprisonment and suicide.

It helps no one if I hold it back.

## Footnotes
[1]  I discovered today (January 17, 2026) that this specific rhythmic contraction is a documented technique known in the West as “[Pompoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompoir)”, which women typically train for years to master. I didn’t train for it. It just... turned on. This confirms that advanced physical techniques can arise spontaneously as symptoms of spiritual shifts—yet another case of [“When Being Becomes Doing”](https://technicallymystic.com/p/when-being-becomes-doing-not-the)
