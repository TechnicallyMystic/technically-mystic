What happens when you don't give the flame air, when you don't let the fire breathe?  
  
It goes out.  
  
It took me exactly 5 days of working on something I truly loved (and falling asleep on the job from sheer exhaustion) to realize this. I woke up and cried as the pattern finally dawned on me.  
  
I'm learning (painfully slowly) that:

- Passion doesn't have to mean smothering
- Love doesn't have to mean strangling
- You can be DEVOTED without being DESTROYED

I'm learning how to let the things I love... breathe.  
That's the training that's still ongoing.  
  
I hope to come back someday with my findings.  
  
But for now, this is the field note: I saw the pattern. I'm in it. I'm learning.  
  
Stay tuned.

## P.S.
Can we appreciate how this post even came?

1. "I want to meditate, but I'm tired from good work”
2. Pass out for 2 hours on my mat
3. Begrudgingly go to bed
4. Tears come out of nowhere
5. Sudden insight
6. Post flows out from said insight
7. I feel a little better

Apparently even the lessons about not strangling arrive by... not forcing them. Who knew.
