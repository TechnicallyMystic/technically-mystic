Subtitle: [Level 1: Transitional] I tried to debug my own spiritual awakening (it didn't work)

I've spent the past couple days trying to write Part 2 of "[When Meditation Stops Being Stress Relief](https://technicallymystic.com/p/part-1-when-meditation-stops-being)." I originally thought I just needed to dig through my journals to find the next strange occurrence after that vivid dream in December 2022 and summarize that arc.

It sounded fairly straightforward. All I had to do was look back at my own field notes, the documentation that I had been recording along the way like a breadcrumb trail. I knew I had even tried to add specific emojis at the top of "important" entries as I went (with a legend to decode what they meant) for when I assumed I would want to reference them again in the future.

## Except...
I dove into months--years--of my incoherent, messy, fever-dream-like journals split between Logseq and Obsidian (my fault for not just picking Obsidian from the start), trying to piece together what got me to this point.

I realized I was trying to debug my own mind with a stacktrace that was literally hundreds of "pages", hundreds of kilobytes of information not even all sequentially linked.

Then I had a further realization after hours of digging through this textual junkyard crossed with a literary sewer, trying to extract something coherent:

I can't.

As much as I want to treat my brain as a computer to debug, I can't. Real life is a mess. And I don't have the system dump of where exactly things started to go off the rails--or if they even did.

## What I did find
As a headache formed from hours of digging through journals and cross-linked files, I found:

- A disclaimer at the top of the main page: "I believe I generally present as a mostly sane person. This is a page dedicated to my secret insanity. Like Jung's Black Books I've been keeping this closely guarded out of sheer terror of being misunderstood or seen as nuts." Also: "There will be shit in here that makes absolutely no sense" (yeah, no shit), and "I don't literally hear voices for the 'dialogues'."
- Pages of arguing with myself (or something that felt increasingly NOT like my usual self)
- Some variation of "am I going crazy" sprinkled in throughout the months (including wondering if I accidentally made a tulpa)
- Half-formed thoughts that made sense late after a late night meditation session but are more or less incomprehensible now
- Long-winded rants about work stress
- Philosophical musings that seemingly go nowhere
- Dreams I can barely remember but seemed significant enough at the time to note down

Parsing through the sometimes funny, oftentimes agonizing entries, I kept thinking: 
"If I can just find the **pattern**, I can explain this period coherently."
"If I can trace this back to the **root cause**, I can write a logical narrative of what got me here."
"If I can **debug** this from my own log output, maybe I can help others understand their own."

But the more I exhausted myself reading through my own raw stream-of-consciousness data, the more frustrated I got until I went to bed late yesterday, defeated by my own field notes.

## What my own mess taught me
Today as I was reflecting on this failed endeavor, I realized:

Spiritual experience doesn't work like code. There's no clean stacktrace. No clear "panic: runtime error at line 247." No single moment (or even *moments* plural) where you can say: "THAT'S where it broke," or in my case, "THAT'S where awakening happened."

Some people can point to a near-death experience (NDE) or some `$PSYCHEDELIC` trip that induced it.

But for me, it was just... messy. Incoherent. Cyclical. Gradual.

But that's how it has to be if you have a life you're not ready to blow up. A job you don't want to lose. A marriage you don't want to leave.

Maybe I'm not supposed to give you a clean stacktrace.
Maybe I'm not supposed to document every step like a "Getting Started" guide.
Maybe the job isn't:
"Comprehensively chronicle the 3.5-year journey from agnostic engineer to 'I moonlight for God.'"
Maybe instead, the job is:
"Share the moments that landed, the ones that can't be explained away, the ones that changed me--even when I don't know why."
Not the entire tangled mess of seeking, but the points that caused me to question the narrative in the first place.

## My approach going forward
I’m giving up on the comprehensive stack trace. I can’t make coherent what is by nature cyclical and beyond any single root cause.

Instead, I’m going to tell you about the moments that mattered, even if I can’t connect them cleanly. Even if it looks like I’m just... leaping from one inexplicable event to another—because that’s what it WAS.

This path has been a series of inexplicable events that somehow (over 3.5 years) added up to... whatever this is. And as much as it frustrates my engineering brain, I can’t give you a reproducible set of steps. Instead, I’m sitting here in my junkyard of journals with a handful of weird moments I can’t explain away.

So that’s what I’ll share: not a linear journey or how-to guide.

Just the moments that made me question everything I thought I knew about reality.

The moments where the boundary between “coincidence” and “something else” got uncomfortably thin.

The moments I can’t explain… but also can’t dismiss.
