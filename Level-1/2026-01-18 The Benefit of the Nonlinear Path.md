Subtitle: [Level 1: Transitional] What once pissed me off is now bringing me entertainment

Turns out I don't need streaming services when my own notes provide infinite content—because the path is a feedback loop I'm only now learning to enjoy.

## The ~~vicious~~ delicious cycle

1. A strange experience or phenomenon happens.
2. I write about it raw, without the Sanskrit name in Obsidian, sometimes with a #HolyShit tag or some other indicator of significance.
3. Months later, I ask an LLM to analyze my journal or a post—and it tells me the relevant Sanskrit name (because it has way more knowledge of the terms than I do).
4. I look up the term. The top link is purple. My eyes go wide.
5. I look up the date the link turned purple in my Firefox history.
6. I check my Obsidian journal entry for that date.
7. #HolyShit tag gets deployed... again.
8. I spawn off more links from the original search, intrigued.
9. They turn purple. I skim through the page, maybe spawn more links (e.g. Wikipedia hole).
10. I get discouraged and/or frustrated and file it away into the "stubborn seeking" bookmark folder on Firefox.
11. I forget I looked it up.
12. Repeat from the top.

And now I’ve realized I’m not simply “documenting the journey.”

**I’m leaving myself proof that**:

- I’m not making it up
- It was happening before I had language for it
- The body knew before the mind did
- The symptoms came before the diagnosis

I’ve been building a _forensic case file_ against my own doubt because I’m a skeptic by conditioning.

And now I’m going back through my journals like a detective finding hidden evidence in old case notes—except **I’m the victim AND the detective AND the witness.**

## A recent case
Gemini's Deep Research used _Antaryami_ when analyzing my most up-to-date manuscript of my awakening thus far.
I didn't recognize it, looked the term up on DuckDuckGo, and then exclaimed: *"WHY IS THE LINK PURPLE?!"*
The date Firefox said I last accessed it? My Obsidian journal had a `#HolyShit` label waiting for me.

*Caption: Investigating when the link for the Antaryami Wikipedia page turned purple*

And then I realized: if I’ve already walked this path without knowing it... **what else is purple that I haven’t checked yet?**
So I started reverse-engineering my own awakening, asking LLMs: “What have I _described_ but not _named_?”
Turns out a lot.
["When Being Becomes Doing"](https://technicallymystic.com/p/when-being-becomes-doing-not-the) is only ringing more true by the search.
## Finding peace
The path being nonlinear used to absolutely piss me off:

*Caption: A meme I once found in February 2025 on the HealthyGamer community. It was too real at the time.*

Now when I find myself walking past the same trail markers I left for myself months ago?
It's all the entertainment I need. I'm somehow finding joy in the journey to nowhere.

## P.S.
I’ve been so entertained by the absurdity of my own breadcrumb-style field notes that I’ve created a new sticker. It’s expected to arrive by the end of the month. I plan to stick one on the bottom of my “Mystics Inc” mug and on my laptop:
