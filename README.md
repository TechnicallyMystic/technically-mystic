## About
I’m a software engineer who started meditating in 2022 to fix my burnout. I was looking for stress relief. Instead, I accidentally dismantled my entire worldview.

**Technically Mystic** is the documentation of that dismantling. It is the logs of an atheist turning into a mystic, written by someone who is still trying to keep their day job.

For a decade, I’ve built systems and lived by logic. But after finding *The Silence*, I went from an agnostic workaholic to navigating the "Dark Night of the Soul" while trying to act normal in morning stand-ups.

This repository serves as a permanent archive of these field notes. It contains all posts and notes as markdown files, compiled into a PDF for easy distribution and preservation.

## Repository Structure (How to Navigate)
The content in this repository is organized by "depth," allowing you to choose how far down the rabbit hole you want to go:
